How to redeem your voucher<cr>
<cr>
- Go to <venda_serveradd>.<cr>
- Select the items you wish to purchase and add them to your basket.<cr>
- Go through the checkout process until you get to the final order confirmation screen.<cr>
- Click on the 'Redeem Gift Certificate' button and copy the Gift Certificate code exactly as shown above.<cr>
- Click 'Continue' to apply the certificate.<cr>
- If the value of your order is higher than the value of the Gift Certificate, you will need to pay the difference using a credit/debit card.<cr>
- If the value of your order is lower than the value of the Gift Certificate, the balance will be added to your account with <venda_ebizname>, and you can use it on future visits.<cr>
<cr>
Please ensure the discount is showing on the order confirmation screen. Once your order has been submitted and paid for by means other than a certificate, you are unable to retrospectively use your Gift Certificate to offset that cost.
