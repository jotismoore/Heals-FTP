How to redeem your Promotional Voucher<cr>
==============================================================================<cr><cr>

- Go to <venda_serveradd>.

- Select the items you wish to purchase and add them to your basket.

- Go through the checkout process until you get to the final order summary page.

- Click on the 'Promotional Voucher' button and copy the gift certificate claim code exactly as shown above.

- Click 'continue'. This will apply the gift certificate.

- If the value of your order is higher than the value of the gift certificate, you will need to pay the difference using a credit/debit card.

- If the value of your order is lower than the value of the gift certificate, the balance will be added to your account with <venda_ebizname>, and you can use it on future visits.

If you forget to click on the 'Promotional Voucher' button cancel your order and start again. Once your order has been submitted and paid for by means other than a certificate, you are unable to retrospectively use your gift certificate to offset that cost.
